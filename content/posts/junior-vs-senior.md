title = 'Junior vs Senior Software Engineers'
+++

One of the differences between junior and senior engineer, besides the amount of code written, is a senior engineer will take the time, before even starting the design and writing any code, to understand what is needed versus what is being asked for. For example, as part of a project business may ask for a manual process to be automated when that process may not be needed at all.
