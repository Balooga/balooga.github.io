Engineering is at the confluence of many departments in the organization. And for the most part these departments don't communicate with each other effectively. For a project to succeed, someone needs to understand and communicate the ramifications of implementing a change or new feature, across the rest of the organization.

* It takes customer service three months to create the scripts and train their customer service reps, but the first they hear about your project is a month before launch.
* As part of your project, UX decide to add the 1-800 customer support number to the UI because of feedback they received during focus testing. But customer support weren't made aware of this minor change and now have to deal with the sudden and unexpected (from their point of view) spike in call volume, and all the associated costs.
* Pay-per-View marketing initiate a project that changes the algorithm to surface PPV content above subscription content in search results, thus allowing their group to meet their target of increasing PPV sales that quarter. But this change lowers customer satisfaction causing churn as customers now see less content on the channels they already subscribe to. Although the change increases PPV revenue, this increase is far outweighed by the loss of revenue on the subscription side of the business.
* A re-ordering in the workflow meant to streamline new installations may expose a loophole allowing 3rd party installers to complete a work order without verifying that the customer has access all the channels they pay for. Thus causing increasing customer dissatisfaction and the added cost of a second "truck roll" to fix the problems from the first install.
* A seemingly simply UI change causes VOD (video on demand) to buffer for customers experiencing congested broadband connections. Because the logic that determines the initial internet connection speed was implemented in the UI component that was removed.

A difference between junior and senior software engineer, besides the amount of code written, is a senior engineer spends less time designing and developing code and more time communicating. Developing an understanding of the market and business and market eases communicating with other groups in the organizaiton understanding the business ask time understanding the business important to spend time understanding what is needed versus what is being asked for as well as any ramifications.
