(v0.2)

The amount of effort and time required to complete any software task is often underestimated. In other words, software will always take longer than you think. Here are three somewhat tongue-in-cheek strategies for estimating any software task;

* Time how long it takes to do a thing the first time and you should have a good enough handle on estimating how long it will take doing *that exact thing* again.

* Alternatively, round your first estimate up to the unit of estimation (day, week, month, etc), then double that. For example, if the initial estimate to complete a project is three and a half months, then round up to four months and double that, giving eight months. Double that again if you are providing this estimate to a producer, product owner or project manager; so sixteen months -- as there are now other groups involved. And the longer a project drags on, the more requirements are subject to change. So although this estimate will be wrong, at least you should have sufficient runway to jump ship to a different project before the uncomfortable questions are asked as to why the delivery date is continually pushed out by three weeks. 

* If you need to hit your delivery date, and this is your first time implementing this feature, and management just sent an email raising concerns about developers padding their estimates; then work towards jettisoning seventy percent of the initial ask. This is called working towards an MVP ([Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)). An MVP comprises of features that, if delayed, will cause a corresponding slip in the project delivery date to accommodate. If the project can launch without a feature then that feature is not MVP.

With a project running late and the deadline fast approaching, what typically happens is a series of spirited discussions with the product owner concerning the list of features that will likely be delayed until after initial launch. These features were considered MVP at the start of the project but are deemed less so as the project deadline approaches. Delaying discussions on MVP until late in the project means that significant effort was expended working on these non-MVP features, instead of having focused efforts on the features that are actually MVP. It is critical to a project's success to reach an agreement on the MVP early in the project life-cycle, and to continue these discussions at regular cadences throughout the project to account for inevitable changes in the market and the associated changes in business priorities. Do not push off these discussions until a week before the deadline.

To summarize;
* It is always a good idea to limit the project scope from the outset. And no-one like surprises, so constant communication is key.
* You need to have worked on *and delivered* a lot of software projects to become proficient at estimating software projects. Experience counts.
