(v0.2)

The amount of effort and time required to complete any software task is often underestimated. In other words, software always takes longer than you think. Here are some (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) strategies for estimating any software task;

* Time how long it takes to do a thing the first time and you should have a good enough handle on estimating how long it will take doing *that exact thing* again.

* Alternatively, round your first estimate up to the unit of estimation (day, week, month, etc), then double that. For example, if the initial estimate to complete a project is three and a half months, then round up to four months and double that, giving eight months. Double that again if you are providing this estimate to a producer, product owner or project manager; so sixteen months. This estimate will still be wrong, but at least you will have given yourself sufficient runway to jump ship to a different project before uncomfortable questions are asked as to why the delivery date is continually pushed out by three weeks.

* If you really need to hit the delivery date; jettison seventy percent of the ask before the project starts. This is called working towards an MVP ([Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)). MVP are those features that, if delayed, will cause a corresponding slip in the project delivery date to accommodate. If the project can launch without a feature, then that feature is not MVP. What generally happens when a project runs late and with the deadline fast approaching are discussions with the product owner on the list of features that can delayed for a version 1.1. These are the features considered MVP at the start of the project but are deemed less so as the projet deadline approaches. Delaying these discussions until late in the project schedule means significant effort is already expended working on these non-MVP features, instead of having focused all effort on the features that are actually MVP. It is critical to the project's success to have an agreement on the MVP early in the project life-cycle, and continue to have these discussions at regular cadences throughout the project (to account for inevitable changes in the market and the associated changes in business priorities) and not a week before the deadline.

To become good at estimating software projects, you need to have worked on *and delivered* a lot of software projects. Experience counts. It is always a good idea to try to limit the project scope from the outset, and constant communication is key because no-one likes surprises.
