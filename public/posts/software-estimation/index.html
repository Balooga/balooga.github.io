<p>The amount of effort and time required to complete any software task is often underestimated. In other words, software will always take longer than you think. Here are three somewhat tongue-in-cheek strategies for estimating any software task;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time how long it takes to do a thing the first time and you should have a good enough handle on estimating how long it will take doing <em>that exact thing</em> again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, round your first estimate up to the unit of estimation (day, week, month, etc), then double that. For example, if the initial estimate to complete a project is three and a half months, then round up to four months and double that, giving eight months. Double that again if you are providing this estimate to a producer, product owner or project manager; so sixteen months &ndash; as there are now other groups involved. And the longer a project drags on, the more requirements are subject to change. So although this estimate will be wrong, at least you should have sufficient runway to jump ship to a different project before the uncomfortable questions are asked as to why the delivery date is continually pushed out by three weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to hit your delivery date, and this is your first time implementing a feature, and management just sent an email raising concerns about developers padding their estimates; then work towards jettisoning seventy percent of the ask. This is called working towards an MVP (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable Product</a>). MVP are those features that, if delayed, will cause a corresponding slip in the project delivery date to accommodate. If the project can launch without a feature then that feature is not MVP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What generally happens when a project runs late and with the deadline fast approaching, are discussions with the product owner on the list of features that can delayed until after initial launch. These features were considered MVP at the start of the project but are deemed less so as the project deadline approaches. Delaying discussions on MVP until late in the project means that significant effort was already expended working on these non-MVP features, instead of focusing these efforts on the features that are actually MVP. It is critical to the project&rsquo;s success to reach an agreement on the MVP early in the project life-cycle, and to continue these discussions at regular cadences throughout the project to account for inevitable changes in the market and the associated changes in business priorities. Do not push off these discussions until a week before the deadline.</p>
<p>To summarize, it is always a good idea to limit the project scope from the outset. And no-one like surprises, so constant communication is key.</p>
<p>You need to have worked on <em>and delivered</em> a lot of software projects to become proficient at estimating software projects. Experience counts.</p>
